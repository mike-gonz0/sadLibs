# sadLibs
This will be project1 for group4
<!-- description -->
The idea of this project, is to create a satirical version of an ad lib creator.

The target audience is you, the person seeking entertainment. sadLibs works by 

first allowing the user to select how many blanks they would like to adlib in 

their given story. Once decided, the user has the option of adlibbing the given 

blanks or clicking the random button until they find a word they like. Once all

blanks are adlibbed, prepare for storytime!! sadLibs can be great content that 

encourages kids to be creative and read, send to someone for a laugh or if you 

need a nice, fun way to give a bedtime story. 


Enjoy!
